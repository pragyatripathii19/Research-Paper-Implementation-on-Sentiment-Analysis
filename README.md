# Research Paper Implementation of Sentiment Analysis

This project implements the methodologies and techniques cited in the research paper ["Classification of Sentimental Reviews Using Machine Learning Techniques"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050915020529) on two datasets:
1. **Spotify App Reviews** – [Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexandrakim2201/spotify-dataset/data)
2. **IMDB Movie Reviews** – [Dataset Link](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/)

## Methodology
The following steps were followed to implement sentiment analysis:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Gained insights into the dataset structure and distribution.
2. **Text Preprocessing** – Cleaning and preparing text data:
   - Cleaning (removing unnecessary characters, punctuation, etc.)
   - Tokenization (splitting text into meaningful units)
   - Removing Stopwords (eliminating non-informative words)
   - Stemming/Lemmatization (reducing words to their base form)
3. **Feature Engineering** – Extracting features using **TF-IDF vectorization**.
4. **Model Training & Testing** – Implemented and evaluated machine learning models.
5. **Results & Conclusion** – Interpreted model performance.

## Achievements
- Achieved **88% accuracy** on Spotify reviews.
- The Spotify implementation received a **Bronze Medal** on Kaggle with 1000+ views.
- Work is **in progress** for applying the methodology to the IMDB dataset.

## Additional Resources
- **Kaggle Notebook (Spotify Analysis)**: [View Here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/pragyatripathiii23/sentiment-analysis-for-complete-beginners/notebook)

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of sentiment classification techniques and their adaptability to different datasets. Future work involves refining models for better generalization across various review platforms.
