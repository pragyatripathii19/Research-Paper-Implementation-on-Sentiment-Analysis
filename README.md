# Spotify_Sentiment_Analyzer

This project uses machine learning to perform sentiment analysis (positive/negative) in over 51,000 Spotify app reviews from the Google Play Store in a step to step manner.

I've followed the following steps:
1. EDA or Exploratory Data Analysis to gain an overview of the dataset.
2. Text Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing data for sentiment analysis
     2.1 Cleaning
     2.2 Tokenization
     2.3 Removing Stopwords
     2.4 Stemming or Lemmatization
3. Feature Extraction using TF-IDF vectorization
4. Model traning and testing
5. Result and Conclusion
