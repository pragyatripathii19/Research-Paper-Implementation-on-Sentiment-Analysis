    "# INTRODUCTION\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment Analyzers are a part of Natural Language Processing (NLP). NLP, simply put, is a machine learning technology that allows computers to understand human language. Chances are, you're already familiar with this technology or have even used it yourself! Smart assistants like Siri and Alexa, chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini, and tools like Grammarly all leverage NLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment Analysis, also referred to as opinion mining, is a specific application within NLP focused on analyzing the emotional tone of text. It aims to classify text as positive, negative, or neutral. For instance, classifying YouTube comments under a video helps creators understand what type of content resonates with their viewers. Similarly, analyzing product reviews helps companies gauge how well their products are performing in the market. As you can see, sentiment analysis holds significant importance.\n",
    "Now that you have a basic understanding of this field, let's waste no more time and dive into the project itself!\n"
